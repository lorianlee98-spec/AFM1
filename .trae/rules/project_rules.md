Git reset whenever there is a mistake in the code
Create a doc parent folder to store all the documentation files
Always use the product-strategy-expert skill during the planning phase
When updating or refactoring the code, always check through all relevant codebase to understand the current implementation and potential impacts of the changes. Then proceed the update without causing any failure in functionality or deleting any important code.
